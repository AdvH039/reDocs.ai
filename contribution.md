# Contribution Guide

We encourage contributions to reDocs.ai! Here's how you can get involved:

1. Fork the Repository: Before making any changes, create a fork of the reDocs.ai repository on GitHub. This allows you to work on your own copy of the code without affecting the main project.

2. Branch for Your Contribution: Create a new branch for your specific contribution using `git checkout -b <branch-name>`. This helps keep the main branch clean and facilitates reviewing and merging your changes.

3. Implement Your Changes: Make your changes to the code, following the project's coding style and best practices. We encourage you to write unit tests for your code to ensure its functionality and stability.

4. Commit Your Changes: Once you're satisfied with your changes, add your changes to your branch and commit them with a descriptive commit message.

5. Create a Pull Request: Create a pull request from your branch to the main branch of the reDocs.ai repository. Be sure to include a detailed description of your changes and any relevant testing results.

6. Respond to Feedback: The maintainers will review your pull request and provide feedback. Be prepared to answer questions, address concerns, and make adjustments to your code as needed.
